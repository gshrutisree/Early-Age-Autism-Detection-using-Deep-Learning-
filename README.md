# Early-Age-Autism-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-

🧠 Early Identification of Autism Through Multimodal Data Using Deep Neural Networks
This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to assist in the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using multimodal data, including images and behavioral questionnaire responses. The goal is to build a reliable, interpretable model to support early intervention strategies.

# 🚀 Features
  Multimodal approach using both image-based and tabular data.
  
  CNN with Transfer Learning (VGG16) for image classification.
  
  MLP/DNN for behavioral questionnaire data.
  
  Streamlit web app for easy interaction with the model.
  
  Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
  
  Early stopping and data augmentation for better generalization.


 # 🗃️ Dataset
  Image Data: Autism-related facial image dataset from Kaggle.
  
  Tabular Data: Autism screening questionnaires (e.g., Q-Chat-10, AQ-10).
  
  Both datasets are preprocessed for training and evaluation.
  
  All data is used ethically and only for educational purposes.
